# Metal-Commodity-Pricing
A time-series and machine learning analysis, including visuals in html and JavaScript, of predicting metal commodity prices obtained from 1990 to 2020

The Data Presented in this Report:
Metal production data from 2011 to 2015 obtained from the USGS, National Minerals Information Center
Metal Commodity Pricing for Aluminum, Nickel, Iron Ore, Copper, and Zinc were obtained from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and downloaded from the St. Louis Reserve Bank

The TensorFlow Keras Time Series Modeling Tutorial (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series#recurrent_neural_network) and AMCharts JavaScript libraries for data visualization were exceptionally helpful during this project.
